Input two integer numbers and divide the larger number by the smaller one. Then display the result using printf() function as a fractional number first and then as a real valued number. 
(Example: 9 divided by 5 shall yield “ 4/5” and “1.8” respectively. )


Solution Methods:
    1. Using if statement (not simplified fraction)
    2. Using Ternary operator  (not simplified fraction)
    3. Using Temporary Variable and Swapping over 1st method to obtain the simplified fraction
