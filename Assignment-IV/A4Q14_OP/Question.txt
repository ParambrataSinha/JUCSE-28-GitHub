Write a C function which takes as argument two strings str1 and str2. It creates a third string str3 which is formed by taking alternating characters from each string and returns it. 
Example: If the two string arguments are “abcd” and “efgh” the function should return the string “aebfcgdh”, If the two string arguments are “abcd” and “efghijkl” the function should return the string “aebfcgdhijkl”. Do not use any string library function. [OPTIONAL]
