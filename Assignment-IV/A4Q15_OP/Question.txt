Write a C function which takes as argument two strings str1 and str2 and an integer i. It returns a new string which is obtained by appending str2 from the ith character in str1. 
Example: If the two string arguments are “abcd” and “pqrs” and i is 2, then the function should return the string “abpqrs”. Do not use any string library function. [OPTIONAL]
